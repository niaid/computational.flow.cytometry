# Introduction to Computational Flow Cytometry in R

The goal of this repository is to provide the course materials that is used for the Introduction to Computational Flow Cytometry in R seminar. It includes the required code and presentation slides. It requires R version 4.3.0+ as well as Rstudio and the `installation.R` script can be used for installation of the required R packages.
