# Introduction to Computational Flow Cytometry in R

The goal of this repository is to provide the course materials that is used for the Introduction to Computational Flow Cytometry in R seminar. It includes the required code and presentation slides. It requires [R version 4.3.0+](https://www.r-project.org/) as well as [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and the `installation.R` script can be used for installation of the required R packages.

Instructors: `Gabriel Rosenfeld and Yuyan Yi`

Contact: `bioinformatics@niaid.nih.gov`

## Installation and Set up

After installing R and Rstudio, open the Rstudio and open the `computational.flow.cytometry.r.Rproj` file. This should open the project in Rstudio. In the console window, execute the following code: `source("installation.R")`
